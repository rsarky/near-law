Task description
============

1) Build a webpage that shows the data in separate fields from the API link below:
(field examples are "citation", "cases_cited", etc. - get all the fields)

http://34.217.226.151:8000/nearlaw/getTESTdata/1

2) Every record to be referenced by the "citation" field as primary key.
Dropdown menu on top would show the entire contents of that record. 

3) After selecting the citation (record), user would have option to click "Edit" button
which would allow the json input for that record to become editable.

4) After editing, user should be able to "Save" the data for that record. 

5) Saving would overwrite the existing data in that record on the back-end db.

6) No delete function is required to be enabled

7) Extra validation: "citation" field can't be changed at all.  It is not editable.

8) All other fields can be changed but should not be null  (0 characters)



Rules
====

1) Only 1 record of data is required to be editable at one time.

2) You have to use MongoDB for backend database (if you require any).

3) You have to use the API link specified for getting the data.

4) Implementation language = Javascript 

5) jquery and other JS opensource libs are allowed.



Please send me the live code on anywhere (jsfiddle, plnkr, etc.) or your own page.

A successful response would have 4 things:

1) Code URL - live and working

2) Code files that compile

along with a reporting of

1) Time taken

2) Lines of Code


Thanks and Best of Luck
